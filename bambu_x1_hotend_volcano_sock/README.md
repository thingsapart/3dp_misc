# Bambu Volcano Sock

Sock Mold for Volcano-length Bambu Lab X1/P1 hotends.

If you run a BL X1 hotend on another printer and use a volca+extender or V6-volcano extender, here's a sock to keep temp fluctuations and cooling effects down.

# How to
Print the 3 mold parts and get some high-temp silicone (either 2-part or RTV). 

1. Prepare the silicone: RTV cures with atmospheric water vapor but that takes up to 5 day, it's better to mix and knead it with water prior to filling it into the mold.
2. Close the two larger bottom pieces by screwing them together.
3. Pour/push/press the silcione into the lower mold.
4. Insert the top part and screw it down carefully, while letting some of the silicone seep out.
5. Wait about a day if you pre-mixed the RTV with water or follow 2-part silicone instructions.
